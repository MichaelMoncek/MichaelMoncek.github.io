title: "Kalokagathia"
excerpt: Any study, but especially the study of mathematics accompanied by long hours spent at the computer, must be balanced with movement. I tried a number of physical activities, of which climbing, both indoors and outdoors, was the winner in the end. Similar to music, this type of sport is excellent for clearing the head and focusing on the present moment, and physically improves posture and muscle mass. <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
